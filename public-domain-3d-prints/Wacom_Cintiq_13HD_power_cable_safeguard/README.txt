# Summary

I always thinked that Cintiq's power connector have weak structure, and were constantly worried that I will break it off if I bump the cable accidentally. I already had disconnections of the tablet for a brief second when this happened from time to time (or even if just moving tablet around the desk). So I made this safeguard, which restricts connector to its place and don't allow it room for wriggling.

V02 update: I rounded up the corners a bit, as I found them to scratch my skin when I draw.

Recommended to print with black plastic, obviously.
