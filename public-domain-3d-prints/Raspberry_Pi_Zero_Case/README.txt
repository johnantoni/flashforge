# Summary

UPDATE: 2017-Mar-16

New case options added - Now supporting the RPi Zero W with onboard Wifi & Bluetooth.

Mounting holes resized for M3 nuts & bolts - m2.5 are difficult to source.  I use clear nylon nuts and bolts which allow the activity LED to shine through the nearest bolt.  The standard RPi mounting hole is M2.5 but with a little care can easily be enlarged for M3.

New options for the Base Plate;
     Open or recessed GPIO, Flush mount or 0.75mm stand-offs for air flow.

Many new options for the Top Plate;
     Open or Closed GPIO,
     Open or closed hole for heat sink (the new W has the CPU slightly relocated, the W versions take this into account).
     Open or Recessed HDMI

1.2 - RPi Zero - Original
1.3 - RPi Zero with camera connector
W   - RPi Zero with camera connector, WiFi and Bluetooth.

******************************************

A basic protective case for the Raspberry Pi Zero original (v1.2) and and the newer v1.3 with camera connector.

Two options for the top section - Cutout for a heat sink or standard with no cutout.

Easy access to Micro SD card and camera connector - no need to dismantle.

There is a cutout on both sections to allow access to the GPIO, Reset and Composite Video Out Pins.
