# Summary

This is a set of four parts designed to hold a 5mm thick glass plate to the heated bed of the flash forge creator pro. The set consists of a RIGHT FRONT, RIGHT REAR, and two pieces for the LEFT side.


UPDATED.   I found on the Flashforge creator pro that when the nozzle extruded its initial filament to clear the nozzle, this scrap filament was getting stuck in the right front holder. I modified the holder to include two sharp angles to eliminate this problem and it has solved this issue. Please use the file "holder_rf_final_ws_r2" to replace "holder_rf_final". If anyone has any questions or comments, please let me know.

# How I Designed This

After trying the other designs available for glass plate holders available on the internet, I found many problems with them either not fitting correctly or not working at all. I decided to design my own parts based on the actual measurements I made. I used Tinkercad to design the parts and after a few tries, I have a set that fits and works perfectly. I am using them now on my printer.
