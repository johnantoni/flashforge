# Summary

**UPDATE 1.1** The case has been updated! Added new switch holder. New lip snap fits halves together, so no need for news! Removed screws holes for amp, Pi 2 and powerboost, just snap fit onto nubs! Added washers to prevent screws from puncturing case.

Raspberry Pi Retro Game Console
This project takes the original concept of the PiGRRL and makes it more powerful, using a Raspberry Pi 2 (or Model B+). It's about the same size but features more buttons (D-Pad, A,B,X,Y, L, R, pause and start.) and four extra buttons on the PiTFT. It's sporting a small audio amplifier and speaker, so you can enjoy the crispy sounds of 8-bit goodness. 

Easier to build!
With this update, we really wanted to make it easier to build. We've dramatically cut the build time in half by making a custom gamepad PCB. Just solder in the buttons and an IDC box header to the gamepad PCB - No more tedious button wiring!

Project Expectations
This project is geared towards beginners, but is still a big project to take on. This guide will walk you through all the necessary steps to wire, assemble and build your very first Raspberry Pi game console. It does require a good amount of soldering, wire tinning and good ol' elbow grease, but don't be discouraged! If your dedicated to take on this project, it'll only take a weekend to make.
