# Summary

The printable dishwasher strainer replacements I found here never were the correct size and even when modified never stayed in place. So I made my own and now so can you!  
Pro Tip: Turn it around and make it a little heigher and with bigger honeycombs so every piece of cuttlery has its own place.  

The .stl is just an example for you to see in Thingiview. Click on "Open in Customizer" to make it the correct size for you.
On request I might add other patterns.

# Print Settings

Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 300µm
Infill: 100%

Notes: 
ABS, PET and Nylon are dimensionally stable up to a temperature of ~120°C (250°F), so this works best. Mine are printed in ABS.
PLA is only stable up to 60°C (140°F). According to jmicgavin in https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:552518/#comments it works, but might not be as durable.  
  
**UPDATE** on durabilty:
After 1½ years of usage, the first one broke (ABS).
I'll just print another one :D
