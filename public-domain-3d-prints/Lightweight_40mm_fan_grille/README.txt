# Summary

For those who want to shave every gram off their printing head in order to fight ringing, or simply want some new stylish grilles to pimp their printer, here is a compact and low-noise replacement for the popular iron fan grilles.

If you print this in ABS with no infill, no more than 2 shells, and thin extrusions, you can get this to weigh 1.20 grams or maybe even less. The iron grilles on my printer weigh 4.14 g each, so by replacing both, I can lose 5.88 g. That's not much, but every little bit helps to reduce the inertia of the printing head and the wobble when it takes sharp corners. I am also thinking of replacing the four long screws with nylon ones, which would probably save me another 7 or 8 grams.

The starting point for designing this, was a grille generated with [Customizable Fan Grille](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:188358) by DanielStein.
